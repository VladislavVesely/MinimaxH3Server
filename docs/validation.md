# Validation and acceptance status

## One-click integration — current main source

Application source revision: `fd2cb3ab4719caaf076f4f178d49d94f6b116113` on **main**
(includes backend `a5d4c6f6679f7863b4fbbbb5af50483b15313ad1`). No new branch or
worktree was created. This section supersedes the historical approval UI and
request-scoped-sudo description below; historical results are not new acceptance.

Executed locally on macOS arm64, Python 3.14.5:

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q -Werror` | **842 passed, 10 skipped** |
| `cd tests/browser && npx playwright test --reporter=line` | **31 passed** (Chromium) |
| `.venv/bin/python -m pip check` | No broken requirements |
| `.venv/bin/python scripts/build_controller.py` | Native root `dist/h3-controller` rebuilt |
| `.venv/bin/python scripts/smoke_controller.py dist/h3-controller` | Both ordinary and `deploy` launch modes passed |

Native executable SHA256:
`b165c9dc01f78170ad86d89b2e466a49fb7c6a661c4971b59043bee1c6aeb228`.
Embedded wheel SHA256:
`602bf560c49169eb26f19e2cf0503d2dc3b1ffa3f6afe3ef3f66dd631ef4a198`.
Smoke verifies the embedded wheel equals every current application source/resource,
including the one-click coordinator, catalog and UI; actual loopback bootstrap,
Host/Origin/CSRF, catalog/license, idle setup, assets and shutdown all pass.
The familiar launcher is `./dist/h3-controller` in the main checkout.

Browser regressions exercise real authenticated controller routes, Deployment,
installer/store, target authorization/activation and selected download records,
with only SSH/native/runtime/download IO controlled. They cover prerequisite
replan, required reboot/reconnect, activation, selected acquisition, reload during
work, cancel/reload, exact pruned digest rejection, sudo rejection, lost/undelivered
responses, stable public retry IDs, stale observations and target reset. Host-trust,
CSRF and generation/video preservation checks remain. These fixture bytes are not
weights or a generated/playable H3 video. No real server was contacted and no
remote packages, drivers, reboot, model download or GPU execution occurred.

TDD failures preceded fixes: obsolete retention checkbox; missing pre-Install
catalog license fields; lost accepted response failing to resume polling. The last
was corrected by scheduling observation after status reconciliation. Independent
read-only review of the integrated committed diff is **pending**, not claimed here.
Ten platform/opt-in Python tests remain skipped. Live Linux setup/reboot/GPU,
Windows native acceptance and Python physical-memory zeroization remain unproven;
offline cancellation cannot guarantee detached remote work stopped.

## Historical validation (prior design/revision)

Validated implementation revision: `7e74cc9cf99be5a74376e385c5b15a636198a208` on `feature/h3-server`.

## Executed checks

| Environment | Check | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| macOS arm64, Python 3.14 | Full `python -m pytest -q -W error`, independently rerun by parent | 736 passed, 10 skipped |
| Ubuntu 26.04 x86_64, Python 3.14 | Full `python -m pytest -q -W error`, executed by parent | 736 passed, 10 skipped |
| Ubuntu | Native systemd parser plus actual launcher/interpreter/argument/PID regressions | 4 passed |
| macOS, Chromium | Playwright suite, final implementation worker run | 27 passed |
| Both platforms | `python -m pip check` | No broken requirements |
| Both platforms | Native PyInstaller build | Passed |
| Both platforms | Packaged executable smoke, independently executed by parent | Passed |

Packaged smoke verifies embedded release wheel, browser assets, runtime manifest and license; actual loopback launches in both supported launch modes; one-use bootstrap, Host/Origin/CSRF protections, authenticated API, and clean shutdown. It does not generate video or contact an installation target.

Browser integration tests exercise real controller/API/store routes with controlled SSH/runtime IO. Their video fixture bytes are **not** generated or playable H3 acceptance evidence. Reboot-related tests use controlled transport loss and independent fixture continuation, not a reboot of a real machine.

The Linux source was exported with `git archive` at the exact revision above, checked by SHA256 after verified SSH transfer, and tested in an unprivileged sandbox beneath `~/MinimaxH3Server/tmp`. Python virtual-environment bootstrapping used `venv --without-pip` and a SHA256-verified pip wheel because system ensurepip was unavailable. Dependencies and build caches remained in that sandbox. No system packages, drivers, service registration/activation, reboot, or model downloads were performed.

## Resolved review findings

- Polling now preserves existing video elements and observes accepted detached installation launches without resubmitting installation.
- Rejected setup actions no longer discard existing installation observation.
- Automatic reconnect is bounded, target/release/root/digest-bound, and observation-only. SSH credential retention requires visible consent and stays in memory; sudo credentials are not retained.
- systemd uses a fixed system-Python `execv` launcher, passing the absolute environment Python path as an argument. Native parsing and actual execution cover equals signs and other special characters without a shell, PATH lookup, or PID change.
- Final narrow independent review approved the last correction. The earlier integrated review's sole remaining code finding was this systemd rendering seam.

## Not yet accepted

- Real H3 GPU execution, offload/LoRA compatibility and a playable generated/downloaded MP4.
- Actual privileged service setup, reboot recovery, or rollback on a disposable Linux machine.
- Native Windows executable execution, ACL/reparse checks and Windows packaging acceptance. Cross-platform source and CI configuration are not proof that Windows CI has run.
- Compatibility of the Ubuntu-built executable with older Linux distributions. Build on the intended baseline and run native smoke checks there.

The inspected target has approximately 29 GiB RAM; the selected recipe documents approximately 75 GB host-memory needs. Its RTX 4090 does not by itself establish that this recipe fits. Hardware suitability, explicit model-license acknowledgment and download approval remain prerequisites to real-model acceptance. There is no hosted inference fallback.

## Local launcher

From the implementation worktree:

```sh
./dist/h3-controller
```

This is the locally built macOS executable. It opens the local browser controller; launching it is not approval for privileged target changes or a model download. Build another native platform with `python scripts/build_controller.py` and verify with `python scripts/smoke_controller.py dist/h3-controller` (use the `.exe` output on Windows).

All automated results above refer to the stated implementation revision. They are not a blanket end-to-end certification.
